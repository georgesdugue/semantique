# Semantique 🖋️

**Just write HTML. We'll handle the style.**

Semantique is a **classless CSS framework** designed for developers who want to build clean, professional websites without writing a single line of CSS or memorizing complex utility classes.

### 🌟 Why Semantique?
- **Zero Classes:** No `class="btn btn-primary"`. Just use `<button>`.
- **Semantic First:** Encourages best practices by styling standard HTML5 tags.
- **Automatic Dark Mode:** Swaps themes based on user system settings.
- **Responsive by Design:** Grids and typography that "just work" on mobile.
- **Lightweight:** Tiny footprint for lightning-fast load times.

### 🚀 Quick Start
Just drop the CSS into your `<head>` and start writing HTML.
